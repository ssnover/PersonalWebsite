	<!-- Hi there and welcome to my website!

I’m an aspiring engineer from a small town near Ithaca, NY. I study Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology. As I’ve pursued my degree, I’ve developed an interest in a number of areas and have begun a number of projects to try out ideas and to solve problems and sometimes just to have a little fun. I built this website as a project for projects. I’m an autodidact and I want to learn as much as there is to know in the numerous fields of engineering that’s cool and interesting to me and that will shape the future of technology and human civilization.

Here I will post all of my projects with little notes as they develop to codify what I’ve learned along the way so that anyone reading through them can have a bit of a head start if they’re interested in duplicating or refining any of my efforts. I hope to continually increase the scope of this website to include more things like a blog and little web apps I’d like to create. If you have any questions for me regarding any of my projects or my thoughts on engineering, technology, etc. feel free to send me an e-mail via the Contact page and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can! -->
