						<em>What do you do?</em>
						<br>
						<br>
						I think about this question a lot. Most people who ask this want to know what your job title is. But that seems like a pretty narrow way to describe everything one does. In the most general sense, I solve problems. And I have the most fun solving problems that people think are hard. This has lead me to seek a career in engineering.
						<br>
						<br>
						<em>Who am I?</em>
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm a student at Rochester Institute of Technology from the Ithaca, NY area. There I'm studying Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and I'm a member of the RIT Electric Vehicle Team. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy and an autodidact. To that end I pursue a lot of projects in various areas that inspire me from time to time (this website is a good example of that). I'm interested in topics as varied as embedded systems, power electronics, Internet of Things, electric vehicles, web design, renewable energy, smart power grids, data science, philosophy, and strength training.
						<br>
						<br>
						<em>Why did you make this website?</em>
						<br>
						<br>
						On this website you can view my adventures into most of these areas on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page and maybe eventually a full blog. On the Projects page I'll detail both finished projects and in progress projects such that my thought process and design process shows through as I go from a faint notion of an idea all the way to complete project. I think this format is vastly superior to the brief description of a project you can fit on a resume or a LinkedIn page as I can add commentary on branches of the project that didn't work out at first and how I addressed these complications, I can add pictures and videos, and a little bit of my character shows through in my writing.
						<br>
						<br>
						In a similar vein, I've set up a <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> page that essentially is styled a little bit like a personal LinkedIn page, but one where I get a little bit more control. There you'll find a comprehensive resume including my work experience, some major projects, my proficiencies, and links to my other professional pages. I'll also include download links to tailored resumes for different industries I am interested in whereby I've cherrypicked relevant projects, experience, and skills and placed them into a one-page standard resume format.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						With all that being said, it is satisfying to have a piece of real estate on the web that I can call my own and to fill it with things I make myself. If you have any questions or just want to send a message my way, feel free to wander over to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page!
						<br>
