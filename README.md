# PersonalWebsite
My humble attempt at web development.

I am building this website as a project to teach myself the fundamentals of web design and development and as a space to display my
projects. I eventually may grow this website to include more elements as I pursue more knowledge in this field.

To-Do's:
- Fix the navbar so that the links don't shift around due to the text transform on mouse over.
- Fill in the rest of the main page contents.
